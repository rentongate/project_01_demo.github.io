I want to make a decision maker for user to choose what they should have for dinner. There is a clip card on the webpage: the front side shows pictures of food dishes, and the back side shows the details of the restaurant, including its name, rating and average cost. I have two jason file in total, one is from Foodish (https://github.com/surhud004/Foodish#readme) that creates random food pictures, and another one is made by myself that contains details of restaurants. 

I take Brian's Flip Card Demo (https://codesandbox.io/s/flip-card-demo-forked-05n9qq?file=/index.html) as the reference when designing the interface.

This project is not finished as I fail to fetch the json files. I'll try my best to fix all the probelms and errors in the future, but I've tried my best for now. I get a headache when I see codes at the moment.
